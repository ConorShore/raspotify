# The displayed device type in Spotify clients.
# Can be "unknown", "computer", "tablet", "smartphone", "speaker", "tv",
# "avr" (Audio/Video Receiver), "stb" (Set-Top Box), and "audiodongle".
#DEVICE_TYPE="speaker"

# Bitrate, one of 96 (low quality), 160 (default quality), or 320 (high quality)
#BITRATE="160"

# Additional command line arguments for librespot can be set below.
# See `librespot -h` for more info. Make sure whatever arguments you specify
# aren't already covered by other variables in this file. (See the daemon's
# config at `/lib/systemd/system/raspotify.service` for more technical details.)
#
# To make your device visible on Spotify Connect across the Internet add your
# username and password which can be set via "Set device password", on your
# account settings, use `--username` and `--password`.
#
# Available devices can be listed with the following command:
# librespot --name hello --device ? | grep plughw -v | grep hwdep -v | grep hw
# This lists available devices (note b1=HDMI1, b2=HDMI2 etc.). 
# If you can’t find your device with that command, try running:
# librespot –name hello –device ?
# This gives a more verbose output, which can help you identify the target
# sound card if it has a weird name
# Say you want Spotify to play out of HDMI1, you run that command, and copy the 
# entire line b1 then you add '--device ' with your preferred device to 
# the OPTIONS field below. For example, you want to set Spotify to output out of 
# HDMI1 you run the command, copy the line 'hw:CARD=b1,DEV=0' from the output and 
# add '--device hw:CARD=b1,DEV=0' to options. Another example using a hardware 
# DAC would be '--device hw:CARD=IQaudIODAC,DEV=0'
# This method is useful, as the name wont change depending on which devices are
# connected to the Pi, as was with the old way (i.e. --device hw:0)

#OPTIONS="--username <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD>"

# Uncomment to use a cache for downloaded audio files. Cache is disabled by
# default. It's best to leave this as-is if you want to use it, since
# permissions are properly set on the directory `/var/cache/raspotify'.
#CACHE_ARGS="--cache /var/cache/raspotify"

# By default, the volume normalization is enabled, add alternative volume
# arguments here if you'd like, but these should be fine.
#VOLUME_ARGS="--enable-volume-normalisation --volume-ctrl linear --initial-volume=100"

# Backend could be set to pipe here, but it's for very advanced use cases of
# librespot, so you shouldn't need to change this under normal circumstances.
#BACKEND_ARGS="--backend alsa"
